# Python Utility Projects - README

## Overview
This repository contains four **Python-based utility applications** designed to simplify encryption, file sharing, and automated document processing. Each tool features an intuitive **GUI using Tkinter** and helps users efficiently manage tasks such as **secure encryption, file transfer, and report generation**.

## Included Projects
1. **AES Message & File Encryptor**
   - Encrypts and decrypts text and files using **AES encryption**.
   - Uses **password-based security** to generate encryption keys.
   - Supports **file selection and processing**.

2. **Message Encryption & Decryption**
   - Simple **base64-based encryption** for text messages.
   - Requires a **secret key** to encrypt and decrypt.
   - Provides **basic data protection**.

3. **Candidate Report Generator**
   - Generates personalized **candidate reports** from an **SQLite database**.
   - Uses **Word templates** and **PDF conversion**.
   - Supports **multi-threaded document processing**.

4. **File Transfer Application**
   - Enables **sending and receiving files** over a local network.
   - Uses **socket programming** for peer-to-peer sharing.
   - Provides a **GUI for easy file selection and transfer**.

## Common Features
- **User-Friendly Interfaces:** All tools leverage Tkinter for interactive UI.
- **Automation & Security:** Streamlines encryption, file sharing, and reporting.
- **Python-Based & Lightweight:** Runs seamlessly on local machines.
- **Efficiency & Performance:** Uses **multi-threading**, **networking**, and **database integration**.

## Setup & Requirements
- Python 3.x## Setup & Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (install via `pip`):
  - `python-docx`, `pywin32` (for report generation)
  - `socket`, `sqlite3`, `base64`, `os`, `tkinter`, `cryptography` (built-in modules)

- Ensure necessary files (e.g., `template.docx`, `database.db`) exist for respective projects.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve **security features** for encryption and file transfers.
- Enhance **report formatting** and customization options.
- Add **progress tracking** for better user experience.

This repository provides **versatile Python utilities** to make automation and security more accessible! ðŸš€
